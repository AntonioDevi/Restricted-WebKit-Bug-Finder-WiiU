Restricted-WebKit-Bug-Finder-WiiU
Webkit Bug Tester/Detector Wii U

This is a program created by dojafoja on GBATemp.net, tweaked by Onion_Knight, and further developed by ant888. The program basically scans all Restricted Bugs in the Webkit Repo, either from GitHub, or from The Official WebKit repository. Coded in Python, might be further developed in C/C++.

TODO

Improve scanner time, it's very slow now and even the newsest version takes 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete scanning.

C/C++ reliability.

For people who are too lazy to compile the .py source as .exe. :P
